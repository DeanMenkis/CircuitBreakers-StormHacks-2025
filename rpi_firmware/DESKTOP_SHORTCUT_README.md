# 3D Printer Watchdog Desktop Shortcut

## 📌 Desktop Icon Created!

A desktop shortcut has been created at `~/Desktop/3D_Printer_Watchdog.desktop`

## 🚀 How to Use:

### **Double-click the desktop icon** to launch the app!

**Icon Features:**
- 📷 Camera icon
- Name: "3D Printer Watchdog"
- Description: "Monitor 3D prints with AI-powered camera analysis"

## 🔧 What the Shortcut Does:

1. **Sets Display**: `export DISPLAY=:0` (for GUI)
2. **Activates Virtual Environment**: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. **Runs App**: `python3 watchdog_app_modern.py` (Modern PyQt5 UI)

## 📱 Using the App:

1. **Position camera** to view your 3D printer
2. **Click "Take Photo"** to test camera + AI analysis
3. **Set interval** (5-60 seconds)
4. **Click "Start Monitoring"** for automatic detection
5. **Watch the log** for AI results: ✅ "Print looks ok" or ⚠️ "Print may have failed!"

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting:

- **App won't start?** Make sure camera is enabled (`vcgencmd get_camera` should show detected=1)
- **No GUI?** The shortcut handles display settings automatically
- **AI not working?** Currently using mock responses - see main README for real AI setup

## 🎯 Status:
- ✅ **Camera**: Working
- ✅ **GUI**: Working
- ✅ **Mock AI**: Working (real AI needs token permissions)
- ✅ **Desktop Shortcut**: Ready!
