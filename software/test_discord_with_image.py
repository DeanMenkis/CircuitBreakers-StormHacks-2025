üîç CRITICAL ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

ONLY report failures for ACTUAL PRINT PROBLEMS:
‚Ä¢ Print is warped, curled, or deformed
‚Ä¢ Print has detached from the bed and is moving
‚Ä¢ Extruder is clogged or not extruding
‚Ä¢ Print has completely failed or fallen over
‚Ä¢ Spaghetti/stringy mess instead of proper layers

ALWAYS CONSIDER THESE AS SUCCESSFUL PRINTS:
‚Ä¢ Dirty or messy print bed (this is NORMAL and OKAY)
‚Ä¢ Old filament residue on the bed (this is NORMAL and OKAY)
‚Ä¢ Dust, debris, or previous print remnants on bed (this is NORMAL and OKAY)
‚Ä¢ Slightly imperfect bed surface (this is NORMAL and OKAY)
‚Ä¢ Tools or objects near the printer (this is NORMAL and OKAY)
‚Ä¢ Print bed that looks used or worn (this is NORMAL and OKAY)

FOCUS ONLY ON THE CURRENT PRINT OBJECT:
‚Ä¢ Is the current print adhering properly to the bed?
‚Ä¢ Are the layers building correctly?
‚Ä¢ Is the print maintaining its intended shape?

üéØ KEY RULE: A dirty bed does NOT equal a failed print! Beds get messy during normal use.

üìù RESPONSE FORMAT:
Write a natural, conversational response. Start with one of these:
‚Ä¢ '‚úÖ PRINT LOOKS GOOD: [explain why the current print is successful]'
‚Ä¢ '‚ùå PRINT FAILURE: [explain what went wrong with the current print]'
‚Ä¢ 'ü§∑ NO PRINTER VISIBLE: [describe what you see instead]'

REMEMBER: Dirty beds are normal! Only flag actual print failures, not cosmetic bed issues."""
